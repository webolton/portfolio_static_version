          <h1>A Change of Scenery</h1>
          <em>Til ills f&oacute;ru v&eacute;r um g&oacute;&eth; h&eacute;ru&eth;, er v&eacute;r skulum byggja &uacute;tnes &thorn;etta.</em>
          <p class="translation">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good for us to travel over good land, only to dwell on this remote headland.&rdquo;</p>
          <a href="http://www.snerpa.is/net/snorri/landnama.htm"><em>–Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</em></a>
          <p class="post">In 874, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ing%C3%B3lfr_Arnarson">Ing&oacute;lfur Arnarson</a> sailed away from his home in Norway and started the first long-term Scandinavian settlement in Iceland. In an effort to escape the increasing centralized authority under King Harold Fair-Hair, a generation of Ing&oacute;lfur&rsquo;s countrymen followed suit and settled Iceland, where they farmed as they had in their homeland and launched Viking raids in Scotland and Northern England.</p>
          <p class="post">&mdash;</p>
          <p class="post">Last summer, I took a JavaScript course to facilitate a digital edition of a medieval text I was working on. By the conclusion of the course, I had developed a front-end application that allows readers to view multiple versions of the same text at the same time.</p>
          <p class="post">It was an eye-opening experience: I loved it. I loved writing the code. I loved the problems that came up, and I loved solving them. I also loved how coding exercised the same mental muscles as the work I did as a researcher of medieval language and literature.</p>
          <p class="post">This spring, I left academia and struck out into unknown territory of my own: I decided to become a web developer. Having just finished <a href="http://nycda.com/">New York Code + Design Academy&rsquo;s</a> intensive summer course, I can say that the more I learn about programming, the more I like it. As I finish up the class, I have been thinking about the excitement and trepidation Ing&oacute;lfur must have felt as he set out for a new land. Though my own adventure is hardly a voyage across the North Atlantic in a rowboat, I am also excited to be embarking into new territory where I can apply the skills I cultivated in academia&mdash;and where there is always opportunity for learning and discovery.</p>
